A Bash-Scripted Chatbot that can open files, small talk, and look things up for You! (Sorry for Windows users, there's no PowerShell version, but I'm sure someone can make it! And also, I think it would be really easy to make a macOS version, since there's only a couple of tweaks)

## How I came up with this idea
So one day, I was just thinking about things that other operating systems have that Most Linux distros don't. Then I came up with a chatbot, because Windows has Cortana/Copilot, and macOS had Siri.
Then I thought Linux deserved its own, so I made one!

Anyway, you can talk to it and most of the time it'll just search it up, but I'm planning to add more features!
