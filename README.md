A Bash-Scripted Chatbot that can open files, small talk, and look things up for You! (Sorry for Windows users, there's no powershell version, but I'm sure someone can make it!)

## How I came up with this idea
So one day I was just thinking about things that other operating systems have that Linux doesn't. Then I came up with a chatbot, because Windows has Cortana/Copilot, and macOS had Siri.
Then I Felt Linux deserved its own, so I made one!

Anyway, you can talk to it and most of the time it'll just search it up, but I'm planning to add more features!
